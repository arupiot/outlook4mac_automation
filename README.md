### Add services keyboard shortcuts in the System Preferences program

Executing the desired script from inside Microsoft Outlook for Mac is much easier once a keyboard shortcut has been put into place.

For this purpose, open the System Preferences program, select Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services.

Scroll to the name of the services you have saved in the previous step and add a new keyboard shortcut by clicking on the right of the service name and using the desired keys.
